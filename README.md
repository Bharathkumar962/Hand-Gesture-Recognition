#Hand Gesture Text Recognition System
The Hand Gesture Text Recognition system is designed to seamlessly translate hand gestures into text, enhancing user interaction. This README provides an overview of the system's architecture, functionality, installation and usage instructions, testing methodologies, contribution guidelines, license information, and acknowledgments.

Architecture Overview

Components:
User Interface (UI):
Entry point for users.
Captures user gestures and displays recognized text feedback.
Video Capture:
Collects video frames from a camera source.
Provides raw material for gesture recognition.
Hand Detection (Hand Tracking):
Identifies and tracks hand position and movement within video frames.
Relies on the Capture Video Frames sub-component for individual frame analysis.
Preprocess Frames:
Streamlines data for effective recognition.
Resizes and normalizes background to ensure uniformity in input data.
Classify Gesture:
Employs advanced techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for accurate gesture classification.
Convert Gesture to Text (Text Generator):
Transforms recognized gestures into textual information.
Bridges the gap between visual gestures and textual content.
Display Text (UI Feedback):
Delivers recognized text output to the user interface.
Enriches user experience with real-time information and interaction.
